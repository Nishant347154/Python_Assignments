1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?
---> shutil.copy() copies individual files.
  shutil.copytree() copies entire directory trees, including all contents.


2. What function is used to rename files??
---> The function used to rename files in Python is os.rename(). 
 This function is part of the os module in Python's standard library 
 and is used to rename a file or directory from the old name to the new name.


3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?
---> send2trash.send2trash() sends files to the operating system's trash or recycle bin.
   shutil.rmtree() and os.remove() functions permanently delete files and directories from the filesystem.


4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is
equivalent to File objects’ open() method?
---> The equivalent method in ZipFile objects to File objects' open() method is ZipFile() itself.
 To open a ZipFile object, you use the ZipFile() constructor. Here's the syntax:

import zipfile

with zipfile.ZipFile('archive.zip', 'r') as zip_file:
    # Perform operations with the ZipFile object

5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf
or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.
---> 
import os
import shutil

def copy_files_with_extension(source_folder, destination_folder, extension):
    # Create the destination folder if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(destination_folder):
        os.makedirs(destination_folder)

    # Walk through the source folder tree
    for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(source_folder):
        for filename in filenames:
            if filename.endswith(extension):
                # Construct the absolute paths of the source and destination files
                source_file = os.path.join(foldername, filename)
                destination_file = os.path.join(destination_folder, filename)
                
                # Copy the file to the destination folder
                shutil.copy(source_file, destination_file)
                print(f"Copied {source_file} to {destination_file}")

# Example usage
source_folder = '/path/to/source_folder'
destination_folder = '/path/to/destination_folder'
extension = '.pdf'  # Specify the file extension you want to search for

copy_files_with_extension(source_folder, destination_folder, extension)


Replace '/path/to/source_folder' with the path to the folder where you want to start 
searching for files, '/path/to/destination_folder' with the path to the folder where you want to copy the files, and 
'.pdf' with the desired file extension.
 This program walks through the source folder tree using os.walk(), checks each file for the specified file extension, 
 and copies matching files to the destination folder using shutil.copy().
